title: Museums as discursive space
author: Tyler

I love the idea of a museum as a discursive space. I actually visited the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) last week— and I’m sure as many can attest to, contemporary art gets people talking. There were tons of interactive exhibits and bizarre pieces that many people would struggle to qualify as art, but the main point (I thought) was just to encourage debate and interaction about the ideas. I don’t think all art has to be about masterful craftsmanship and skill, especially if the artist’s main goal is just to stir up some trouble. By the same token, I would also say that not all museums have to be about masterful curatorship and “service to the public.” Museums can simply be platforms that people use to explore themselves and others’ work, and that’s perfectly fine.

From the “Curatorship as Social Practice” article though, I do agree that there needs to be less focus on the object-centric approach to curating pieces (which often ends up turning into an eye candy-centric approach). Although, the need to extend museum spaces into recognizing the “interplay of objects, people, and societies” also has its own confusing implications. Who decides the interplay? What responsibility lies on the curator in a discursive space? Of course these are all subjective decisions, but this leads me to think that when comparing these two approaches to curatorship, the most important question to ask is simply “how much do we step in?”
